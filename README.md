## Features
*Realistic Snooker Table: A digitally rendered snooker table that adheres to official dimensions and aesthetics.

*Physics-Driven Gameplay: Utilizing Matter.js for ball dynamics, ensuring lifelike ball movement and collisions.

*Intuitive Cue Control: Mouse-based cue action allowing players to click, drag, and release for shots, mimicking the real-life cueing action.

*Collision Feedback: Immediate on-screen prompts for cue ball contacts, aiding players in strategizing subsequent plays.

*Multiple Game Modes: Includes standard play and an 'Extreme Mode' for heightened difficulty, featuring smaller balls and dynamic obstacles.

*Responsive Design: A modular codebase that provides a seamless and scalable gaming experience.

## How to Play
*Select a game mode using the keyboard.

*Place the cue ball by clicking within the "D" semi-circle.

*Aim by clicking and dragging the mouse away from the cue ball; the direction and length of the drag determine the aim and power of the shot.

*Release the mouse button to take the shot.

## Extreme Mode
*Activate by pressing '4'.

*Navigate additional challenges such as miniature balls and randomly appearing holes on the table.

*Aim to avoid these malignant pockets, or risk losing the ball and potential points.
